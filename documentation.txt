Documentation:


1. UML (at least 3 diagrams)
2. Metrics (at least two. Sonarcube would be great)
3. Clean Code Development (at least 5 points you can show me)
4. Build Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc.
5. Continous Delivery (show me your pipeline in e.g. Jenkins and Travis-CI)
6. AOP (show me where you could have integrated AOP stuff => the jointpoints)
7. DSL (Create a small DSL Demo example snippet in your code even if it does not contribute to your project)
8. Functional Programming (prove that you have covered all functional definitions in your code as
        only final data structures
        (mostly) side effect free functions
        the use of higher order functions
        functions as parameters and return values
        use clojures / anonymous functions
9. Show me an idea where to use a logical solver in your code and how you would do it!
     Write a little code fragment (like data preparation etc.) in Scala or Clojure!
